        <!-- Kath's Story -->
        <div class="story-card">
            <h5>Kath from Manchester</h5>
            <p>
                After being diagnosed with womb cancer, Kath made significant changes to her diet and lifestyle,
                including eating more fruits and vegetables and incorporating regular exercise into her routine.
                These changes not only helped her recover from cancer but also reduced her risk of developing
                other chronic diseases.

        <!-- Laura's Story -->
        <div class="story-card">
            <h5>Laura from Pudsey</h5>
            <p>
                After losing her mother to lung cancer, Laura quit smoking, a major risk factor for lung cancer.
                This decision significantly reduced her risk of developing lung cancer herself.

        <!-- Justine's Story -->
        <div class="story-card">
            <h5>Justine from Liverpool</h5>
            <p>
                Diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer, Justine changed her sun-exposure habits, including avoiding
                sunbeds and always using sunscreen when outdoors. These changes helped protect her skin from
                further damage and reduced her risk of developing additional skin cancers.

        <!-- Message Section -->

            <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
            <p>
                These stories highlight the power of personal experiences in motivating positive lifestyle changes.
                While these changes may not guarantee a cancer-free life, they can significantly reduce the risk of
                developing cancer and other chronic diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preventing cancer is a complex issue with no single solution. A combination of factors, including
                genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures, can contribute to cancer risk. However, making
                healthy lifestyle choices, such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding tobacco
                and excessive alcohol consumption, can significantly reduce the risk of developing cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have concerns about your cancer risk, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional
                who can provide personalized advice and guidance.
